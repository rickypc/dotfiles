Richard Huang dot files
=======================

Central repository for maintaining my own dot files, and a compilation of configurations developed over the years for various apps that I use daily.

They might not work for you, but feel free to use them.

Platforms: GNU/Linux (RHEL/CentOS) and Darwin/OS X

Installation
-
You can git clone dotfiles into your non-empty home directory with one command:

```bash
$ cd; git init; git remote add origin https://github.com/rickypc/dotfiles.git; git pull
```

Or, if you would like to use SSH clone URL like myself:

```bash
$ cd; git init; git remote add origin git@github.com:rickypc/dotfiles.git; git pull
```
